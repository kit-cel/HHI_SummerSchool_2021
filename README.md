# PyTorch examples and presentation (pdf) shown in the talk "End-to-end Modelling and Optimization of Optical Communication Systems using Deep Learning" presented at the "AI for Optical Networks & Neuromorphic Photonics for AI Acceleration" summer school at Fraunhofer HHI

In this repository, you can find some of the examples that are shown in our presentation called "End-to-end Modelling and Optimization of Optical Communication Systems using Deep Learning" presented at the "AI for Optical Networks & Neuromorphic Photonics for AI Acceleration" summer school at Fraunhofer HHI. Authors are Laurent Schmalen, Boris Karanov and Vincent Lauinger.

Additionally, you can find the slides accompanying the presentation (for background information) in the root directory.

Usage of Python Notebooks
-------------------------
The programming language [Python](http://www.python.org) is usually pre-installed in current Linux distributions and OSX. Additionally required modules need to be installed by hand from the packet sources. Alternatively, we highly recommend to use readily available Python distributions that are tuned for data science. One such distribution is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda is also the preferred method to install a complete Python environment on a Windows machine. If you are using Anaconda, we advise you to create an environment within you run the notebooks. You can directly create the environment for running the notebooks using the provided environment.yml file using `conda env create -f environment.yml`. You can then activate the envinronment using `conda activate PyTorch`.
